    <h1>ILDG Storage Element</h1>
    <p>
      This is the internal interface of an ILDG-compatible storage element.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should not be publicly visible.
      If you can see this and are not setting up the element,
      the person in charge of the element would probably appreciate
      you getting in touch with them to let them know.
